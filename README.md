## User-Story

As a traveler I want to see the weather outlook wherever I wish to go. I want to be able to plan my trip for expected weather in multiple cities during my travels.

## Description

The app features a seach bar that allows the user to search for many different cities and display the cities weather, wind speed, humidity and UV Index. I used the
OpenWeather One Call API: (https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve this data.

## Deployed-Site

https://tylerzeman.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

## Features

As mentioned above the app displays the 5 day forecast including UV index, wind speedf, and of course temperature displayed in Fahrenheit. The site also includes a
search history to look up previously searched cities. There are also icons to showcase weather for the days as well such as if it were to snow then a snowflake will 
appear on said day.
